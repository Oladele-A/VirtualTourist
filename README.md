# VirtualTourist - Project 5, Udacity iOS Developer Nanodegree.
The Virtual Tourist app downloads and stores images from Flickr. The app allows users to drop pins on a map, as if they were stops on a tour. 
Users will then be able to download pictures for the location and persist both the pictures, and the association of the pictures with the pin.
The project requires to persist a complex model using Core Data, and plist persistence of an array of dictionaries.

### Concepts Learned
- Using URLSessions to interact with a public restful API
- Creating a user interface that intuitively communicates network activity and download progress
- Storing media on the device file system
- Using Core Data for local persistence of an object structure
